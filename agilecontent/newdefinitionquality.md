# First publish then edit vs. First time right: 
## a new measurement of translation quality: 

a) the speed at which you can make changes
b) the speed at which you can improve your process upon defects

Goal: To tell people what happens if you focus on lower costs of change instead of review cycles. 
So that they will start to focus on the right things and hire me to help them make it happen.



- don't focus on translation quality, focus on product quality (for all users)

- how to obtain product quality? focus on the quality of process.

The notion of translation quality has been the subject of many misconceptions of what is important in international content


What happens when a mistake is found

- example: ebay

How is quality to be defined?
It is all about meeting the needs and expectations of customers with respect to functionality, design, reliability, durability, & price of the product.

Sounds logical, right? Yet, somehow when we apply this to translation, things change. 

Take this blog from a random LSP I found on the web when Googling "Quality Assurance" 

"Unfortunately, there is no single definition regarding what is a high-quality translation. However, what many linguists agree upon is that a high-quality translation at least meets if not exceeds the expectations of the client and the target audience. But this doesn’t mean that all translation that meets a client and target audiences’ needs is of high quality.
For example, if a straightforward, one-page document needs to be converted into another language, a linguist doesn’t need to be an expert. 
In fact, a machine translation can do, and a linguist can edit the text after it’s translated. 
You won’t really call this translation high quality, but it meets the expectation of the client and the target audience. Given that quality is subjective, it’s honestly difficult to measure linguistic quality. 
Still, all LSPs follow a process that ensures quality assurance in translation.

I'm taking this blogpost as an example, but it is no different from what most LSPs are claiming. We cannot measure quality, it's all subjective. 
And: we are putting a 



Over-processing
Doing more to a product than is required by the end-customer results in it taking longer and costing more to produce. 
This also includes using components that are more precise, complex, expensive or higher quality than absolutely required.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)#Over-processing)



The mistake: don't look at translation quality, look at translation process quality: the difference between QA and QC




Translation quality is defined by the speed at which 

- focus on how fast you can fix the mistake
- use the mistake for process improvement







boekdrukkunst: first time right
nu: digitaal en dus kun je alles wijzigen
als je dat slim doet dan gebeurt er iets anders: dan ga je ook meer focussen op user feedback en de waarde die dat heeft
sneller publiceren, meer waarde
content/translation quality is measured by the amount of time to improve your content
nodig:
goeie manier om user feedback te organiseren
sneller manier om wijzigingen door te voeren
