# The problem with Language Service Providers (aka translation companies)


Goal: Show how our current translation ecosystem stops us from delivering real value to end users and is the cause of the lack of effective innovation: innovation that enhances delivering to users what they need, at the time they need it, with a high ROI.  


In this article, I will argue that our current ecosystem reinforces translation to be treated as separate from content creation, leading to a lack of innovation in the translation industry. This is the reason we haven't yet solved the problem of publishing content in multiple languages. It is still slowing down the time to market, leads to numerous quality issues, and is too expensive to guarantee a proper ROI. 

## How it all began

When content was mostly published on paper, you almost had no choice but to take a waterfall (avant la lettre) approach to translation. Translation management was a tedious task, mostly because content was only stored in files, and was sometimes even shared through faxes and other means of hard copy devices. 

Making a change to something that was already sent out to a translator was a no go. So a source text had to be fully revised before it could be sent out, and if there was a necessary change, this was a big deal for whoever was in charge of getting translations done. 

Of course, no company wanted to deal with this. Because who wants to add to their core business:

* Finding translators by putting adds in newspapers and getting through tens or 100s of applications
* Sending documents back and forth to translators
* Making changes in the source text in 10 languages that were corresponded through email
* Doing all the tedious work that project managers in LSPs are doing these days (and that makes them cry on a regular basis)

This is how translation companies came into existence. Yuka Nakasone once told me the story of how the entire translation industry - including all LSPs, MLVs and SLVs - was designed and ordered by a tech giant. With their hundreds of millions of dollars of localization projects back then as well, they were able to order the entire ecosystem as we know it right now. 

Translation companies promised to fix the problems they encountered in the translation process, even if they were caused on the client side. They optimized their part of the system, starting off from a signed off source text, and maximized their revenues on that model. Very useful! Until now...
  
 ## Moving to an agile mindset in an online world
 
In this digital world, time to market is everything. The sooner you publish or deploy, the sooner you can start making money. Holding off on publishing until everything is perfect is a great pitfall and can destroy the value you create. 

All content is online and can - and will - be changed on the basis of user feedback at any time. People writing content - whether they're in marketing, support or in product, know that they're not algmighty and that they need to adjust their content on the basis of the wisdom of the crowd.

Effectivity of content is key, and whether or not it's effective can be measured in one way only: by giving it to the user. But it needs to be fast. And to reach the full potential: it needs to be fast in all languages. 

Agile methodology in software development and other industries, has also taught us that having multidiscplinary teams collaborate in creating MVPs and iterating over that first version, is far more effective than working in silos, where there is no way "up the waterfall" and problems detected later on in the process can never be fixed where they originate. 
  
When we make the mindshift to a more agile approach to translation, we start thinking differently about a lot of things. Semir Mehadzic, one of my fellow agile minds in the localization industry () gives some examples in reply to one of my posts on LinkedIn:
"
* We don't want to do LQA (Language Quality assurance aka reviewing - ed.) in the same environment/context as the translators
* We're not even sure separate LQA is needed at all
* We're OK with the possibility of releasing an occasional spelling or other error to production (to save time and reduce the complexity)
* LSPs are really not needed if you have text strings to translate and have an automated way to dispatch them
* We dont't believe in KPIs and error-count metrics as a way to measure quality
"

While these statements were absolutely unimaginable 20 years ago, the current situation of how online content is stored and the requirements of the world we're living in, are asking for these kinds of bold statements. That is, if we ever want to deliver a high quality multilingal product; quality as defined by the user: what he needs, at the time he needs it, at the costs that he is willing to pay for it. 

And, of course, this online world also makes it easy to find really good translators, that know how to translate, but also, that understand much more of the translation process than you can ever imagine. I was shocked when only 4 years ago, at a conference, I heard people saying about translators: oh no, they just want to type words on their attic, they don't want to be bothered with client side problems, nor be involved in the process. Some waste of talent and expertise, right? 

We can store content online before it is published, we can make and track changes at any time, we can find translators online, we can get feedback from our users. We have project management tools in the cloud, we are able to track what has happened when. We can see lean and agile processes implemented in other industries, all we have to do is look at what they do and what they've learned. 

The time is now! We have all the ingredients for real collaboration and the right use of talent and expertise, and we can finally eliminate some serious waste in our global content processes. We have all the tools to really become creative and design more sophisticated processes. Finally, we can give equal rights to speakers of all languages and serve them with content in their languages without a blink of the eye!

Right? 

Eh... no

## Where we really are

In most companies, translation is still considered a cost instead of an opportunity. Many companies still do not translate their content because they fear the costs and the time it takes, which is of course negatively affecting their international ambitions. In case translation is felt to be necessary, it usually leads to a long delay in time to market, for both content and products. 

You could even argue that our world economics are not reachting its full potential because we cannot overcome the language barriers and we're not taking full advantage of our product potential internationally.

Somehow, we are not taking advantage of all the opportunities this new digital world is offering. Translation is still an afterthought for most companies and this is making the translation process run into all kinds of bottlenecks.

In a way, it is not surprising this is happening. 

The ecosystem that currently exists is **inherently** set up as a waterfall process. In many cases, there are three processes that function independently from eachother: the content creation process, the in-house project management of translation and the outsourced project management of translation. 

You finish your source text, you notify your translation department, who sends it to a translation agency, they do something with it (potentially through subvendors, all with their own process) and then a translation is returned. The translation department is responsible for making sure the content is validated and published. 

There is usually no contact between the translator and the owner of the content, there is hardly any feedback about textual or technical issues with the source text, and if there is, there is no system that allows for these kinds of feedback loops, as is usually the case in waterfall processes. All this while from the translation process, valuable information can be acquired about the quality of the entire process of the creation of content.

## Why is this a bad thing? 

One of the main principles of Lean is to optimize the whole: optimizing the entire value stream. Suboptimization is "the practice of focusing on one component of a total and making changes intended to improve that one component and ignoring the effects on the other components". Suboptimization is a problem, not only because you often optimize the wrong component - which does not lead to the intended overall result, but moreover, doing so more often than not has unintended and surprising consequences in places that you cannot see 

Translation companies have optimized their (sub)process and this has led to suboptimization. They have - logically - focused on maximizing their profit, not taking into account what this does to the overall value stream. So eventhough they often have the right intention, their entire operations are focused on efficiency of (their part of) the translation process, and not on the overall business goals of their clients. 

The big problem that this situation causes is the fact that problems are hardly ever structurally solved. Even when there is a long lasting relationship between a translation agency and a client, and they claim they are working upstream to improve the process, there is usually no one person responsible for the entire process of multilingual content creation. Because this would take a process manager on the client side that systematically monitors the the process of the translation company, or someone from the translation company do the same on the client side. Both very unlikely scenarios.

This means that structural changes to the content creation process, systems or client side translation processes in order to enhance the translation process on the side of the agency are very unlikely to take place. 

In rare cases there is alignment of processes, but this only happens for the very large enterprise accounts. And even then, cases of real integration of processes, where content creation and translation are one, and true collaboration and feedback loops are facilitated are a needle in a hay stack. 

## Why is this so hard to change?

The narrative that most translation companies use in their marketing is that they solve your multilingual problems. Work with a translation agency, and you are relieved of all this tedious work that you encounter when publishing in multiple languages. This message has as a consequence that companies do not understand that a lot of the tedious work actually originates in their own processes and they need to take ownership in order to really solve the problems that are encountered. 

Translation agencies are paid to "take care of things", so in most cases, the client perceives them as the "problem-fixer". It is incredibly hard for an agency that is in this position to influence the process on the client side. My personal experience while working for a translation agency, is that most clients are surprised if you ask questions about anything related to their business goals and what they need in order to achieve those. Although this should always be the starting point for any activity. 

The same often goes for the localization managers that are running translations within a company. Even they are not able to influence the processes that really need improving, because translation is seen as something completely different from the core business of the company.

My hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the narrative of translation companies, that spread the vision that translation is something to outsource, that it is a nuisance that you do not want to have anything to do this. Obviously, they have to tell this story, or they would be out of business real soon. But the question is whether it is true, and if it doesn't increase the issues with multilingual publishing instead of solving them.

This narrative is strenghtened by the business model of translation companies. Because you pay for a translation by the word, this completely obscures the fact that the translation agency is doing everything but translating. They do project management, they source and train translators, they build tools and many other things. And this is all paid by the word. No wonder noone seems to realize that a translation process entails much more, both on the side of the agency as internally, than translating words. 

I believe another narrative is needed to solve the real problem. And that is: take ownership.

## How to solve it? 

What we see is that tooling and processes around translation have become extremely complex, exactly because of this waterfall approach. No wonder a lot of companies  want to get rid of the tedious work that needs to happen when something that went wrong in the beginning of a process, but wasn't too big a problem, explodes in your face at the end of a project when the severeness of the problem is multiplied by the number of languages you are translating into. 

However, if companies take ownership of the translation process, (and refrain from treating their localization/translation department in a waterfall way), they will start to see that translation can point to a lot of issues in the creation of the content, which actually makes that a more scalable process as well. Only then will the real cause of the problem be fixed, and this will enhance not only the translation process, but the entire process. 

Once you start removing waste systematically, you will see that translation project management is no different than any other project management task. I claim that if you integrate your processes and apply an agile and/or lean approach, you do not need any experts in translation. You will get expertise about the several languages straight from your translators.

With some advice on the right tooling and processes, you will be able to build a smooth, automated process for all content, whether it's original or translated content, and this will benefit cost, speed and effectivity of your multilingual publications. 

# Should LSPs cease to exist?

You might think that I believe that Language Service Providers are the source of all evil, and that I think they should not exist at all. This not entirely the case. I believe that if they can reinvent themselves, and their business model, they can really make a difference when it comes to multilingual publishing. All they  need to do is offer the services that are now all included in the word price as separate services and support their clients that want to take ownership. Examples are: sourcing and educating translators, paying translators, consultancy, solutions. 

This will have an amazing impact on translation processes, as a lot of brilliant tooling is now hidden from the customers, and is built only to make sure their client is locked-in on buying words. And who can blame them? As long as organizations are doing what they've always done, selling words is one of the most profitable things to do in the translation industry. 

# What can happen if organizations take ownership of translations





* a lean, integrated process where all languages are delivered at the same time, giving the same quality to all users, irrespective of their language.

## Ending statement
We see that companies are ready to take this step. So either LSPs will make the change, or your clients will. It's up to you.

For ages, translation companies have tried to promote themselves as companies that make translations faster, cheaper and better. In this paper I will argue that in the current ecosystem and in the current business models they are doing the opposite. I will discuss the root cause and what change it takes to solve it. 



Introduction: 
Translation companies, or Language Service Providers (LSPs), as they're called nowadays, are providers of logistic services. The actual translation is usually done by external translators, and the main service they provide is project management.  

Until about 10 years ago this service really had added value. Finding translators, managing the translation project, managing files, sending and receiving them to and from translators for multiple languages was really a task you'd rather outsource than have in house. As there was only one chance to publish, and agile was far from arriving anywhere near translation, having a separate company that took care of this was indeed very valuable.     

But now...
* Translators can easily be found online
* Automation reduces the need for file handling
* Publication is done in the systems of the client 
* Files are in the cloud now

These changes open up a huge potential to increase the speed and quality of publishing multilingual content and cutting out middle men. But somehow... this is not happening to the extent that could be possible. 


The value of LSPs
So what is the value 


* op welke manier leveren LSPs nu toegevoegde waarde? Wanneer zijn ze van toepassing?

* Nowadays, Translation companies have the most value when the processes at the client side are broken. They are alleviating their clients of the responsibility to fix what is broken, and what should be fixed. 
* In order to maintain a client lock-in, they develop tooling that can only be used for/by a client as a total package with translation included

Wat gaat er mis? 
* problemen die in je content creatie ook al zitten en daar ook al waste opleveren, worden bij vertalen naar meer dan 2 talen opeens onbeheersbaar
* deze problemen komen te liggen bij de vertaalbureaus
* bij het optimaliseren van hun proces hebben ze maar invloed op een klein deel van het proces
* problemen liggen buiten hun zicht, namelijk bij de vertalers, die ook alles zelf zitten op te lossen
* oorzaken van de problemen liggen buiten hun invloedssfeer 
* dit wordt suboptimalisatie genoemd, waarbij je een deel van het proces optimaliseert zonder te kijken naar de impact van je optimalisatie voor het grotere geheel

Cambridge dictionary: Suboptimization: a situation in which a business is not as successful as it could be because one part or department works only on its own or only for its own success

Gevolg: 
* deze manier van oplossen levert:
  - huilende project managers
  - lagere time to market dan mogelijk
  - hogere kosten dan mogelijk
  - teveel middle men
  - dubbel uitgevoerd werk
- waste of time, talent and knowledge about what must be improved (translators) => vertalers 
    - dit vergt een apart artikel
    - vertalers (waar de problemen zich manifesteren) staan veel te veel stappen af van de oorzaak
    - geen collaborative workflow mogelijk
  - geen werkelijke verbetering, geen werkelijke innovatie


Wat maakt het moeilijk om het op te lossen?
* belofte LSPs: wij lossen het voor je op: - omdat lsps zich hebben gepresenteerd als "ontzorgers" hebben ze alle verantwoordelijkheid bij hun klanten weggenomen
* als ze het echte probleem oplossen maken ze zichzelf overbodig
* business model LSPs 
lastig: je verdient gewoon het meeste door 100% marge te pakken op vertaalkosten
bizarre situatie: project management en zelfs software wordt verdisconteerd in de prijs van de vertaling 
=> no incentive for clients to improve anything as it will not have any effect on the translation costs: why invest in improvements when there is not ROI, apart from higher time to market, which they promised they'd take care of, right? 


Hoe dan wel?

* companies to take ownership of the translation process and have identical processes for working with freelancers or LSPs

* companies to align or integrate it with the process it belongs to and to use the same project management tool for translation as for the process translation belongs to

* take out middle man when it comes to project management

* companies to work Lean and apply continuous improvement, improve what must be improved

* Building an infrastructure with best of breed tooling, where project management, workflow automation and TMS is separated

* LSPs to deliver - if anything
- advice on how to run processes yourself
- translator management, not project management

What will happen:
- 







 
















Nowadays, Translation companies have the most value when the processes at the client side are broken. They are alleviating their clients of the responsibility to fix what is broken, and what should be fixed. 










hoe lossen de grote LSPs dat op:
* ze ontwikkelen technologie die klanten nodig hebben maar doen een lock-in 













So... clients expect all problems to be solved and be unburdened. 

There are a few problems with this concept:

1) 


translation companies try to push back on what is expected from them. But then there's a problem. If we can't expect that, what is their value?


But then, in order to deal with this, they're optimizing their part of the process. This is again not allowing  And we're stuck with suboptimization




- business model
=> word prices
=> paying for something that they're not doing
=> tegengestelde belangen
- separate processes
=> suboptimization: impossible to really align with clients +. subprocess of subprocess
=> no option to go for more sophisticated processes
- no possibility for collaborative workflow/



- no link with users, comparison of KPI's across different languages <= true QA <= judged on the wrong metrics

- innovation is stopped
