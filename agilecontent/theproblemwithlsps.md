the problem with lsps

- business model
=> word prices
=> paying for something that they're not doing
=> tegengestelde belangen
- separate processes
=> suboptimization: impossible to really align with clients
=> no option to go for more sophisticated processes



- no link with users, comparison of KPI's across different languages <= true QA


- innovation is stopped
