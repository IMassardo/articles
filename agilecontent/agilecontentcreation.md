# Goal

This article aims to pitch the idea of using agile principles to authoring in order to facilitate collaboration and improve quality and time to market of (multilingual) content. 

# Collaborative authoring made painless 

Ever wrote a piece of text with blood, sweat and tears? Trying to make it perfect before you sent it to the editors or for peer review? Only to find that no matter how great you thought your article was, people always come up with something to improve on your piece, sometimes with corrections that touch the core of your story? A very painful moment, which makes it hard for any normal human being to remain open to feedback and learning. 

By the time you have rewritten your piece, gone through the review cycles and are ready for publication, the subject you wrote about has already expired. Too bad, you were too late to get the views and the discussion you were hoping for. 

Software developers have experienced this for decades. So many software projects, even when they are relatively succesful, are delivered too late for the features to be what the user wants in this moment in time. In the current speed of change, everything has to be deployed yesterday in order to be up-to-date with current needs. 

In this article I propose to use the principles of agile software development and apply them to (multilingual) content creation. My goal is to encourage you to see your content as something that is valuable to others in many stages of the process, and not just when it is done. And to show you how this way of working can solve innumerous problems when it comes to translations.   

## Publish your MVP and get feedback: Minimal Viable Publication

### What is an MVP? 

In software development, an MVP stands for minimal viable product and is the name for the first version of a product that has value and could be deployed. In authoring the MVP stands for 'minimal valuable publication'. The MVP is the version that contains all necessary information to be potentially valuable to peers and/or users AND that can trigger feedback. On the basis of their feedback, iterations can be made, which may, for instance, lead to publication to a greater audience or merely a piece that is more effective. 

### What are iterations

The improvements on the MVP on the basis of the feedback that constitute a new deployable product

### How does iterative authoring work? 

When you start writing, you start with determining the goal of your publication. If you have not set a goal, the purpose of your piece is unclear, and the feedback will not help you to determine whether your goal was reached. 

Then, make a first version really fast, that outlines your ideas. Your MVP should potentially reach the goal that you are aiming for with your content. At the intersection of maximizing the work not done and potentially reaching your goal is where your MVP lies. 

The goal of your MVP can be a number of things: it can be to see whether the topic is of any interest to anyone, to test whether your content is indeed answering to the goal you are trying to achieve and/or to get as much information from your collaborators or users in order to improve on your content. 

When you are working collaboratively with other authors and/or editors, the MVP can be just an outline of what you are trying to convey. When you are publishing to the world, you might want to make the piece a bit more attractive by adding a picture and an appealing title, so that people are inclined to read your piece.

And then: PUBLISH. Either to your collaborators, peers, or the world. Make sure you get the feedback you need. Ask people very specific questions about whether it is reaching the goal you have in mind.  

Make sure your readers, whether they are collaborators, peers and reviewers can give their feedback in a shared tool, preferably with excellent version control and always in the cloud. If you can get a conversation between your readers going, you know you're onto something good!

But no, you're not done yet. Publishing is not the end, it is the beginning. Iterate until you feel your goals have been met and your focus group agrees. 

### What are the advantages

1. More structured writing and less writer's blocks

Often, in trying to achieve a 'ready for the world' publication, people tend to spend a lot of time on phrasing and rephrasing what they would like to say. Especially for the MVP, but possibly for all versions of your publication, having a good story is more effective than creating a perfect text. 

In order to create the MVP you have to stay true to the principle of 'maximizing the work not done'. Do the work that is necessary to make your piece valuable, but do not fall into the trap of wanting to make it perfect. 

If you do this, you will reach a complete story sooner, and the structure of your piece will not be cluttered with digressions.

2. faster publishing - less risk, more value
3. always a publishable version, so you can make the deadline even if you have underestimated the effect of hanging out in a bar the night before the deadline. 
4. early feedback from editors and therefore a broader perspective
5. less pain when receiving feedback - the smaller the text the easier it is to incorporate even small changes
6. early involvement of translators in the case of multilingual content

The key to agile publishing is that it is not the end result that counts. It's the process of collaboration that will determine the value of your work. 

## In case of multilingual content

### When do translators come in?

At the very beginning. Translators can function as one of your peer reviewers, by translating your MVPs for a broader audience.

### Why would you want to involve them so early?

1. translators are power-users of your content and will therefore provide you with valuable feedback on your source content. 
2. early feedback from reviewers in several languages and therefore broader focus groups and insight in cultural differences
3. better and faster translations: Translating as you go will give you an almost real time translation of your publications. Quality emerges from collaboration and commitment.  

### Isn't that expensive?

Let me ask you something else. Is it not expensive to work on a piece of content for a long time and then have someone translate and it just doesn't sound as good as your original piece. Isn't that a waste of valuable time and therefore money?

The only way you can reassure yourself of a high quality translation is to collaborate with your translator. Make him/her part of your thoughts, of your process. A nice side-effect is that you don't have to allocate any translation time: you will have a translation at merely the same time as your source is final. 

So what happens if you take this approach: 

1. you will speed up your time to global markets
2. it will make your content more valuable
3. it will make your translation more valuable
4. if you have the right tools, and you source knowledgeable translators yourself, translation is not expensive. Translating as you go is less expensive that paying a translator a rush fee.

### What do I need to enable collaborative translations? 
1. version control and a reviewing workflow on your source text; e.g. through GitHub
2. translation environment, supported by Machine Translation, but only if it supports predictive writing 
3. Very good processes and knowledgeable collaborators
