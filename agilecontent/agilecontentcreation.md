# Goal

This article aims to pitch the idea of using agile principles to authoring in order to facilitate collaboration and improve quality and time to market of (multilingual) content. 

# Collaborative authoring made painless 

Ever wrote a piece of text with blood, sweat and tears? Trying to make it perfect before you sent it to the editors or for peer review? Only to find that no matter how great you thought your article was, people always comes up with something to improve on your piece, sometimes with corrections that touch the core of your story? A very painful moment, which makes it hard for any normal human being to remain open to feedback and learning. 

By the time you have rewritten your piece, gone through the review cycles and are ready for publication, the subject you wrote about has already expired. Too bad, you were too late to get the views and the discussion you were hoping for. 

Software developers have experienced this for decades. So many software projects, even when they are relatively succesful, are delivered too late for the features to be what the user wants in this moment in time. In the current speed of change, everything has to be deployed yesterday in order to be up-to-date with current needs. 

In this article I propose to use the principles of agile software development and apply them to (multilingual) content creation.

## MVP: Minimal Valuable Publication

* What is an MVP? 

An MVP stands for minimal viable product and is the name for the first version of a product that has value and could be deployed. 

* What are iterations

The improvements on the MVP on the basis of the feedback that constitute a new deployable product

* How does this relate to authoring?

The MVP is the version that contains all necessary information to be reviewed by peers and users. On the basis of their feedback, iterations can be made until the content is considered useful to be published to a greater audience. 

* What are the advantages
1. more structured writing
2. less writer's blocks
3. always a publishable version, so you can make the deadline even if you have underestimated the effect of hanging out in a bar the night before the deadline. 
4. early feedback from editors and therefore a broader perspective
5. less frustration when receiving feedback
6. early involvement of translators in the case of multilingual content

* What does an MVP look like? What should it contain?



## In case of multilingual content

* When do translators come in?

At the very beginning. Translators can function as one of your peer reviewers, by translating your MVPs for a broader audience.

* Why would you want to involve them so early?
1. translators are power-users of your content
2. early feedback from reviewers in several languages
3. better and faster translations: real time translation of your publications  

* Isn't that expensive?

No. 

Because:
1. it will save you a reviewer
2. it will make your content more valuable
3. it will make your translation more valuable
4. you will speed up your time to market 
5. if you have the right tools, and you source knowledgeable translators yourself, translation is not expensive. 

* What do I need to do this?
1. version control and a reviewing workflow on your source text; e.g. through GitHub
2. translation environment, supported by Machine Translation, but only if it supports predictive writing 
3. Very good processes and knowledgeable collaborators
