## The trouble with writing content

Ever wrote a piece of text with blood, sweat and tears? Trying to make it perfect before you sent it to the editors or for peer review? Only to find that no matter how great you thought your article was, the crowd always comes up with something to improve on your piece, sometimes with corrections that go at the core of your story? A very painful moment, which makes it hard for any normal human being to remain open to feedback and learning. 

By the time you have rewritten your piece, gone through the review cycles and are ready for publication, the subject you wrote about has already expired. Too bad, you were too late to get the views and the discussion you were hoping for. 

Software developers have experienced this for decades. So many software projects, even when they are relatively succesful, are delivered too late for the features to be what the user wants in this moment in time. In the current speed of change, everything has to be deployed yesterday in order to be up-to-date with current needs.
