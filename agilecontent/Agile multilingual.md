# How translation can help you create better content

# Goal of this article
This talk aims to explain how applying agile principles to content creation and translation will significantly reduce waste and lead to a better end result. 

## The issue with translation
Translation is usually organized in a waterfall process. Induced by the current ecosystem with translation companies, content must first be ready and consolidated in order for a translator to start working. Letting translators work on content that is not quite done to most people, feels like 'a waste of time and costs, as the content will still change'. 

But then translating begins, and the trouble starts. There is no way up the waterfall, so the translators have to deal with the source content they get.
Lots of ambiguous sentences, untranslatable idioms and sentences that become too long in the translated version are issues 
that translators have dealt to cope with, but that reduce their productivity severely and may impact the quality of the end result - time, costs and quality of the translations are all affected.

## The value of translators
Moreover, and more importantly, translators can be seen as the first users of your content - and hardcore users. 
They will notice issues that the authors have not thought of when writing or editing, 
simply because translators dive into the matter more thoroughly than anyone reader. In the current translation ecosystem, there is no efficient infrastructure for translators to express their valuable feedback and it is often seen as 'complicating things and disturbing'. 

## What can we solve if we combine this? 
The obvious answer: including translators in the authoring process will not only improve the quality of your translations, 
but will also impact the quality of your source content. However, for this to work well, the authoring process needs to be adjusted: to a more collaborative, iterative process that allows all contributors to give feedback on publishable, eventhough not finished versions. 

But how to go about this? Often, translating earlier versions is seen as a time-consuming, expensive addition to translating after the article is done. So how do you make sure collaboration with translators leads to more value and to faster publishing, more feedback from your users AND early involvement and empowerment of your translators?

For this we need take another perspective on collaborative writing, using agile principles from software development. In this article I will explain how a paradigm shift towards taking a more agile and collaborative approach on authoring and translation will free you of waste in content creation and translation.
