# How translation can help you create better content

# Goal of this article
This talk aims to explain how applying agile principles to content creation and translation will significantly reduce waste and lead to a better end result. 

Some time ago I wrote *this piece* on how to apply agile principles to authoring, leading to a less painful process with better outcome. In this article I will explain a bit more how this paradigm shift towards taking a more agile and collaborative approach on authoring and translation will bring even more benefits when you add translation to the process.

## The issue with translations
Translation is usually organized in a waterfall process. Induced by the current business model of translation companies (LSPs), content must first be ready and consolidated in order for a translator to start working. But then translating begins, and the trouble starts. There is no way up the waterfall, so the translators have to deal with the source content they get.

Lots of ambiguous sentences, untranslatable idioms and sentences that become too long in the translated version are issues 
that translators have learnt to cope with, but that reduce their productivity severely and may impact the quality of the end result - time, costs and quality of the translations are all affected.

## The value of translators
Translators can be seen as the first users of your content - and hardcore users. They will notice issues that the authors have not thought of when writing or editing, simply because translators dive into the matter more thoroughly than any reader. In current translation ecosystems, there is usually no efficient infrastructure for translators to express their valuable feedback and it is often seen as 'complicating things and disturbing'. 

## What can we solve if we combine this? 
The obvious answer: including translators in the authoring process will not only improve the quality of your translations, 
but will also impact the quality of your source content. 

But how to go about this? Often, translating earlier versions is seen as a time-consuming, expensive addition to translating after the content is done. So how do you make sure collaboration with translators leads to more value and to faster publishing, more feedback from your users AND early involvement and empowerment of your translators? For this to work well, the authoring process needs to be adjusted: to a more collaborative, iterative process that allows all contributors to give feedback on publishable, eventhough not finished versions. 

## First publish, then translate, then edit
The most important mind shift you need, is that you actually "publish" early versions. Publishing can be thought of in many different ways, obviously, it doesn't necessarily have to be to a public website. And more importantly: publishing is not the end of your process. It's the beginning.  

Now you can do two things with these early publications. 
1) ask peers for feedback, so you don't get caught by surprise when you think your content is all done
2) ask your translators to translate AND give feedback and ideas on anything and everything: is the structure clear, is the wording accurate and clear for readers, etc. 

The nice thing is that translators are usually quite good with language and content and they have seen A LOT of copy. Imagine having this whole army of linguists at your disposal that are now only asked to translate, but that can actually help you make your content better in the very early stages. 

On the basis of the feedback the content gets adjusted and changes get implemented in all languages. Obviously, the time to market for these languages will be much faster, and most likely the translated copy will be better, as the translators will be engaged in the content already and have seen the process, so will know better what is important to the copy writer. 

But also, what will happen is that your copy writer will be much faster. She doesn't have to make the content perfect before they publish, and there will be so much feedback about what MUST be changed, and not what COULD be changed. This reduces a lot of rewriting that you could basically consider waste and gives a writer so much more confidence. 

Of course, if you're really bold you already publish content for readers to give feedback on and you measure if the goal has been achieved. All this to make sure you "maximize the work not done". 

## What do you need?

Easier said than done? Just give it a shot and see for yourself. There are some things that you need to make this work, but what you really need to do is just experiment and make things better step by step. 

Here are 

* An agile mindset: you're not afraid to show your preliminary work to the world
* Direct contact with your translators
* Trust in the capabilities of your translators
* A way to publish your content
* Tooling so translators will understand what has been changed. Usually a translation memory is used for this, but this is not necessarily the best option.
