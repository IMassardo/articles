Outline 2: From project manager to process manager

Goal: to show what the difference is between running a project and running a process, to show what it means to be a process manager, 
and how from this, it follows that you should not have a localization dpts that execute projects

Introduction:
- we're all used to looking at translation as projects
- seems so logical: you're done with the source and then you "just" translate it into another language
- and then of course, you hire people that can run these projects to make sure this goes as fast and smooth as possible - without anyone else being bothered by it

Problem solved. Right? 

Not really. 
- looking at it this way is creating inequality between languages. Translated languages are always lagging behind the original ones. This means your 
- eventhough translation is essential for international growth, it is seen as a cost center
- Project managers are under pressure to make the time to market as fast as possible but have no influence on the aspects that are essential for achieving that

The task that most Localization managers are trying to accomplish:
- make a shift left, make sure translation is no longer an "afterthought". Because everyone remotely familiar with translation understands that you should create your product "with translation in mind". 
- How do they do this? Create awareness, be present, warn people for problems that will arise, ... 

Most Localization Managers, however, just hit a wall when trying to accomplish anything outside their own department. Which leaves them being the person always trying to make people's lives harder. 

Real problem:
- what people fail to see is that the issue lies in the organizational structure - and not in people or systems
- traditionally, translation is put into a matrix-organisation, where additional processing is done after the production is done. 

- looking at translation as separate projects from your primary processes, you lose track of your value stream. There is no connection to what your user is willing to pay for. 

Leads to:
- endless discussions about quality and what that's allowed to cost
- no connection with the business goals or the metrics that tell you what the user wants and that can help you improve your output so that there is maximum value added for the user. 
- no clear numbers on what the bottlenecks in the translation actually costs the company, in terms of opportunity costs, delay in time to market and unfit content for several markets

What needs to change: the mind set

- see that you're not delivering translations but a multilingual product
- see that localizing your content is a process, not a project. 
- from this it will follow that translation processes must be part of your primary production processes, part of your value chain and should not be handled in a project organization nor in a secundary process

So what is the difference between a project and a process? And why does it matter?

"Simply put, a process is a set procedure that involves a sequence of steps that need to be taken in order to produce a result, whereas a project is a temporary course of action that aims to deliver a distinctive product, service, or result."

And what is the difference between a project manager and a process manager? 

A project manager makes sure all tasks are done in order to receive a result that are set for that project. A process manager continuously improves the process and is therefore more concerned with the quality of the process, rather than a deadline. Where of course the belief is that a process of high quality always leads to a predictable and qualitative result.


So what happens if you treat translation as a project? 

- If you look at translation as a project, the focus on the value chain is lost. This means there is no system to discover whether the actions that are taken are actually adding value to the product, aka what the user is willing to pay for. This is why translation is so often seen as a cost center. 

- The people working on the project are just focused on the task at hand: delivering the content in time (meaning: as requested by someone in the company), with a constant search for metrics to see what the translation quality is. As a project manager, you focus on fixing issues in an ad hoc manner "no matter what", just to make a deadline. 

- As translation projects are so separate from the primary processes, improvements are usually patch work,.
 
- even if your project manager can still see clearly after having to deal with the operational tasks that comes your way when you're in a translation project, and that sees the real cause of the problems they're experiencing, they usually do not have the power to change anything, nor the system to show why a change is necessary. There is usually no connection between the strategic business goals and the people in the localization department.

What happens if you treat translation as part of a primary process - and have someone own the entire process? 
- you focus on process improvement, leading to faster turnaround times every single time you run the process. 
- you see what value is added by the actions of the translation activities
- you only improve what actually adds value, in most cases leading to a lot less review steps and faster turn around times
- you discover the waste and its root causes - usually they're in the content creation part
- you will get rid of the task of project management - the end of the waste of talent
- eventually you will deliver all languages at approximately the same time - if that is valuable to your user experience (which it usually is)

From this it will inevitably follow that you need a process owner that does have the power to oversee the entire process that creates value for your user. This is never translation in itself. It is always a multilingual product. There is no such thing as a translation process, there are only mulitilingual product processes. To make it more clear:
- there are multiple primary processes that contain translation. One for the creation of a multilingual software product. One for the creation of multilingual support content. One for the creation of international marketing content, etc, etc. 
 
Which also leads to the question what a translation department is supposed to do. As project management is supposed to be taken out of the equation - as a natural consequence of the improvements - and process management should be done on the entire process, as to optimize the whole, there is really no need for such a department. 

What do you need:
- expertise on process management and process improvements
- solution architects

So what about localization experts? 
- They're already out there. They're called translators.

Introduction:
- more and more organizations feel the need to install a localization department that takes care of all translations and 
that is separate from the other departments in the company. 
- in this article we explain what the problem is that is attempted to be solved by doing this.
- and we propose a different approach
- waarin de focus ligt op de bedrijfsprocessen ipv het in 1 keurslijf stoppen van alle vertaalprojecten


the issue with translation

- is that translation is not the issue
- it appeared translation agencies couldn't solve the entire puzzle
- so companies were still left with a lot of work, usually:
          - at the end of the project
          - with problems that can only be fixed with workarounds

So let's define the problem
- the problem is that unexpected errors come up at the end of a project

What is often thought of as a solution:
- build an internal Localization Department 
- that runs projects after content has been delivered in the source language
- that tries to prevent/foresee problems that will arise in that project
- so that all content will be published in time in all languages 

What often happens:

- a lot of problems cannot foreseen, nor prevented, but need to be solved over and over again
- basically: content to be translated is still thrown over a wall, now to a Localization department, and then to an LSP (translation agency)
- a lot of tasks are duplicated. Leading to unnecessary loss of money and time 
- Localization project managers are not connected with the business goals and therefore they do not have any insight, nor power to make necessary changes on either side of their subprocess (content creation and translation). We created yet another stressful job where people have to deal with problems they didn't create and cannot solve structurally

Maybe step back a little: what is the real cause of the problem?
- that issues are not fixed structurally

And why is that? 
- because we're looking at translation as projects, that need to be delivered at a certain time, no matter what - separate from content creation.
- with  metrics (costs, "quality", timelines) that have very little to do with the demands that are specified for the product. 

What is the right solution:
- not only to view creation of multilingual content as a process - and not as a project, but let translation be part of business processes, instead of trying to create a "one size fits all", separate process

First: What is the difference between managing a project and a process? 
"Simply put, a process is a set procedure that involves a sequence of steps that need to be taken in order to produce a result, whereas a project is a temporary course of action that aims to deliver a distinctive product, service, or result."

And what is the difference between a project manager and a process manager? 
A project manager makes sure all tasks are done in order to receive a result that are set for that project. A process manager continuously improves the process and is therefore more concerned with the quality of the process, rather than the quality of the outcome. Where of course the belief is that a process of high quality always leads to a predictable and qualitative result. 

## But that's not all

- well known in the literature: suboptimization leads to problems
- one of the issues if you do process management for subprocesses: how do you define your requirements? Need to be defined from the user perspective, users don't care about subproducts.

So what's the process to look at? It's your business process! And translation should be part of it. 

## concluding: what does this mean?
- there should be process managers for your business processes and if there is multilingual content involved, they should be responsible for the **process** of translating it
- (technical) localization people should behave as solution consultants that can assist with finding solutions for the improvements that the process manager addresses
- There is no such thing as a translation process. 


## What will happen?

- If the process manager masters a good system to detect bottlenecks, he will slowly but surely speed up the delivery process of the product at hand, including the tranlsations. 
- There will be no more discussions about translation quality and how to measure it; it will be about product quality and it will be measured in the same way as you do with your source language. If that's not measured, then maybe start there... ;)
- Issues in translation will be solved where they originated. More often than not that's where the content is created
- no more workarounds and band-aids in order to make a deadline at all costs, which complicates the translation part of the process incredibly
- your project manager will become obsolete, as an explicit goal of the process improvements


## How?

Process management is a skill and it takes some getting used to in order to stay away from the traps that project managers run into. It's key that if you still need a project manager, which should be optimized away as soon as possible, that they aren't too good. They will solve every problem before you have a chance to structurally fix it, and take away the chance for a real improvement. 





-----------------------------------------



Reality:
- a lot of problems cannot foreseen, nor prevented
- Localization project managers are not connected with the business goals and therefore they do not have any insight, nor power to make necessary changes
- basically: alsnog over de muur gegooid, nu naar een LD en vervolgens naar een LSP
- alles wordt nu dubbel uitgevoerd


What is the real problem:
- 




Organisaties hebben vaker en vaker een localization department. maar is dit wel de juiste richting? 

Hier een verhaal over hoe het anders kan

er is steeds meer besef dat je zelf een rol hebt bij het vertalen van je content
omdat het resultaat niet goed is 
omdat vertaalbureaus jouw probleem niet kunnen oplossen en er nog veel werk aan de buyerkant zit



dit besef is een stap in de goede richting

oplossing is: inrichten van een localization department with project managers. 
eigenlijk: een interne LSP 
dubbel werk Loc Dpt en LSP
interne afdelingen lopen tegen dezelfde problemen aan als LSPs: aan het einde van de keten en geen macht om iets te veranderen
proberen om met alle macht problemen (voor zichzelf) te voorkomen
rol van “waarschuwer”: niet de meest graag geziene collega
nog meer weerstand op vertalen
vaak te ver van business goals en teveel gericht op kwaliteit van de vertaling in plaats van waarde voor de klant
ze proberen problemen in de output op te lossen als ze voorkomen
ze proberen problemen te voorkomen door tegen iedereen te zeggen dat ze aan vertalen moeten denken en hun expertise in moeten roepen
uiteindelijk een bijzonder stressvolle rol, met veel tijdsdruk en weinig waardering, pieken en dalen, en weinig structurele verbeteringen


deze oplossing geeft aan dat er niet goed naar de oorzaak gekeken is van de problemen
want wat is nou de reden dat: 
de kwaliteit niet volgens plan is
het te traag is
het schreeuwend duur is
en vooral: wat is de reden dat we het (blijkbaar) meestal niet goed weten 

De reden is:
Dat is dat we niet naar het proces kijken maar naar de uitkomst. Sterker nog. Dat het proces voor het grootste gedeelte gedeelte buiten het zicht en verantwoordelijkheid van de owner ligt:
content creatie proces
vertaalproces bij LSP

Wat blijkt als we wel naar het proces kijken? Dat problemen vaak worden veroorzaakt bij het creëren van de content en door het gebrek aan collaboration tussen vertalers en andere medewerkers in het proces, veroorzaakt door groot aantal schakels in het proces

Er een schakel tussen zetten in de vorm van een LD, verbetert de problemen niet, het verergert de problemen. Nog meer stappen in het proces verergert de situatie, en de waste in het proces. 

Dus wat hebben we nodig:

Een procesmanager in plaats van een project manager. En wel een manager van het gehele proces van meertalige content.

Hoe doe je dat, een proces managen?
definieer outcome metrics
vertaal deze naar process metrics
bijv: step times, limieten, 
maak het proces behapbaar: maak kleine deeltjes
streef naar flow - geen onderbrekingen in je proces
ontdek de bottlenecks
analyseer de root cause
improve what MUST be improved, not what CAN be improved
PDCA: is de oorzaak opgelost? wat is de volgende bottleneck? 


Wat gebeurt er dan:
Er komt meer samenwerking tussen de verschillende medewerkers
Problemen worden opgelost op de juiste plek voor ze grote problemen worden, maar nadat ze voorkomen: business case met real life voorbeelden.
