How to translate UI strings, or, how one piece flow saves the day. Every single time.

Na quick scan support ook quick scan UI.


Easy LMS:
- Improvement Kata from Toyota: single item flow. 

Probleem:
* how to make the process scalable, and faster

=> updates deployed without translations: slordig 

Quick scan revealed:
- scalability: how to add new languages and not add new people? 
- speed: how to deploy translations sooner so clients in all languages could profit from new features right away.

Assumption: translation tool with in-context translations is the solution because the translators are asking for it and the main problem is the questions from the translators about the context of the UI

what did we do:
- ran a questionnaire with the translators
- investigated the current processes

Findings:

- very happy translators. did not reckon they would get much faster or better if tooling or process changed. Context was indeed missed, but solved by a great project manager who knows a lot about the product
- translators were open to doing translations more often, on a daily basis even, without any changes to the process
- many processes in one "translation process": dev process and marketing process
- although working in one piece flow for dev, not including translation in the process. Translation still in batch

Advice:
- Split translation processes in marketing and UI process
- add translation to the one piece flow 
- make different deal with translators
- add translators to the internal process: give them access to the project board so you will make them more self-supportive
- only then vaststellen wat nou eigenlijk het echte probleem was waardoor het niet kan schalen en waardoor het niet opschiet

Outcome: 
- Jeroen was reluctant to start with one piece flow for translations. he already knew the problem, you didn't need to investigate it further by going to one piece flow
- when he did anyway, the context problem solved itself. with a number of small adjustments, translators had access to the jira cards and had all the info they needed. 
- They now translate on a daily basis, simply by asking them.
- so now every story is translated within a day, instead of in two weeks

Conclusion: 
- problems seems big when you do them in batch, but easy when you do them in one piece flow. It will allow you to solve the problem that really exists. not one that is created by a false sense of efficiency.
- translators are flexible, especially when you include them in your process. They are professionals that do not need much management, as long as the agreements and expectations are clear and if they're listened to.
