Translation: no more projects, but a continuous delivery process


Description of innovation
Until now, Continuous Delivery has been addressed as something that translation processes should be aligned with.
But what happens if we start looking at translation projects as a continuous delivery process as well and take all of the learnings from the software industry and apply them to translation? 

Why is this a good/innovative solution 
The notion of 'maximizing the work not done', defining an mvp (minimal viable publication) and relying on user feedback for iterating on it will, just like in software development, minimize the risk and costs and time to market.

How can others us it? â€“ are there costs to this? (50 words or less)
At first sight this might look like this will lead to an increase of translation costs, as the same translation will be revisited. 
However, if we learn to let go of extensive QA-cylces and publish sooner, this will actually decrease costs and increase value.

Background - How did the need arise and how did you get to formulate a solution. Walk us through your process for innovation. (50 words or less)
As translation is usually an afterthought and dealt with in a waterfall method, working in the translation industry is often a stressful experience. 
Comparing translations to software development has given lots of insights on how to deal with the speed/quality/costs triangle. 


Is it already being used in "real life/work" setting? Please explain. (30 words or less)
We are implementing this process right now in our current assignment, where there is a tight deadline and not all content is viewed as extensively.
